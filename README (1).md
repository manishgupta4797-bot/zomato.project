# # SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

![ERD](https://github.com/MANISHKJAWALE/zomato_sql_project/blob/main/erd.png)

## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;
```

### 1. Dropping Existing Tables
```sql


-- 2. Creating Tables
create table customers 
			(customer_id int primary key,
			customer_name varchar(75),
			reg_date date);
			

create table restaurant
			(restaurant_id int primary key,
			restaurant_name varchar(75),
			city varchar(75),
			opening_hours varchar(75));
			
create table riders
			(rider_id int  primary key,
			rider_name varchar(75),
			sign_up date);
			
create table orders
			(order_id int primary key,
			customer_id int references customers(customer_id),
			restaurant_id int references restaurant(restaurant_id),
			order_item varchar(75),
			order_date date,
			order_time time,
			order_status varchar(75),
			total_amount float);
			
```

## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
select * from orders where order_id is null 
	or customer_id is null 
	or restaurant_id is null 
	or order_item is null 
	or order_date is null 
	or order_time is null 
	or order_status is null 
	or total_amount is null 
```

## Business Problems Solved

### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.

```sql
select customer_name, order_item, no_of_order,rank from
	(select o.order_item, c.customer_id, c.customer_name, count(*) as no_of_order ,
	dense_rank() over(order by count(*) desc ) as rank
	from  orders o 
	join customers c on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
	where order_date >= current_date - interval '2 year' and customer_name = 'Arjun Mehta'
	group by 1,2,3 order by 2, 4 desc) as t1
	where rank <=5
```

### 2. Popular Time Slots
-- Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.



```sql
select
	case
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 0 and 1 then '00:00-02:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 2 and 3 then '02:00-04:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 4 and 5 then '04:00-06:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 6 and 7 then '06:00-08:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 8 and 9 then '08:00-10:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 10 and 11 then '10:00-12:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 12 and 13 then '12:00-14:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 14 and 15 then '14:00-16:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 16 and 17 then '16:00-18:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 18 and 19 then '18:00-20:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 20 and 21 then '20:00-22:00'
		when extract(hour from order_time) between 22 and 23 then '22:00-00:00'
		end as time_slot, count(order_id) as order_count_hourly,
		dense_rank() over(order by count(order_id )desc)
		from orders
		group by time_slot
```



### 3. Order Value Analysis

```sql
select o.customer_id , avg(o.total_amount), count(o.order_id), c.customer_name,
	dense_rank() over(order by  avg(o.total_amount) desc) as rank
	from orders o
	join customers c on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
	group by 1,4
	having count(order_id)>750
```

	group by 1,3
	having sum(o.total_amount) >100000 
```

### 5. Orders Without Delivery

-- Return each restuarant name, city and number of not delivered orders 

```sql
select r.restaurant_name , o.order_status, count(o.order_id) from orders o
	left join restaurant r on r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id

				from restaurant r 
				join orders o on r.restaurant_id= o.restaurant_id 
				where o.order_date >= current_date - interval'2 year'
				group by 1,2)

	select * from ranking where res_rank = 1
```

## Conclusion

This project highlights my ability to handle complex SQL queries and provides solutions to real-world business problems in the context of a food delivery service like Zomato. The approach taken here demonstrates a structured problem-solving methodology, data manipulation skills, and the ability to derive actionable insights from data.

## Notice 
All customer names and data used in this project are computer-generated using AI and random functions. They do not represent real data associated with Zomato or any other entity. This project is solely for learning and educational purposes, and any resemblance to actual persons, businesses, or events is purely coincidental.
